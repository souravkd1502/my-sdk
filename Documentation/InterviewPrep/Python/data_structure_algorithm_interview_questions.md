# Answer

Below is a detailed implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using Python's built-in OrderedDict from the collections module. This data structure helps maintain the order of keys based on the sequence they were inserted or accessed, which is ideal for an LRU cache.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Overview of LRU Cache
An LRU Cache evicts the least recently used items first when its capacity is exceeded. It supports two primary operations:
- **get(key):** Returns the value associated with the key if it exists in the cache; otherwise, returns -1. It should also update the item as most recently used.
- **put(key, value):** Inserts a new key-value pair into the cache. If the key already exists, update it and mark as most recently used. When the capacity is exceeded, the least recently used item is removed.

### 2. Using OrderedDict
`OrderedDict` maintains insertion order. However, by using the `move_to_end(key)` method, we can also update the order to mark keys as "recently used". This behavior is leveraged as follows:
- **Accessing an element (get)**: If a key exists, we move it to the end to mark it as most recently used.
- **Inserting or updating an element (put)**: Insert the key-value pair and move it to the end. If adding the new element exceeds the capacity, remove the first key-value pair (which is the least recently used).

### 3. Implementation Details

#### a. Data Members
- `cache`: An OrderedDict to store key-value pairs.
- `capacity`: Maximum number of items that the cache can hold.

#### b. Methods
- **__init__(self, capacity)**: Initializes the cache with a given capacity.
- **get(self, key)**: Retrieves the value and updates the key's position.
- **put(self, key, value)**: Adds or updates the key-value pair and handles eviction if necessary.

### 4. Code Implementation

Below is the full implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        """
        Initialize the LRUCache with a specific capacity.
        :param capacity: Maximum number of items the cache can hold.
        """
        self.cache = OrderedDict()
        self.capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        """
        Retrieve the value associated with the given key.
        :param key: Key to search in the cache.
        :return: Value if the key is found, otherwise -1.
        """
        if key not in self.cache:
            # Cache miss, return -1
            return -1
        # Cache hit: move the accessed key to the end to mark it as most recently used
        self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        return self.cache[key]

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        """
        Inserts or updates the key-value pair in the cache.
        If the cache exceeds its capacity after insertion, evicts the least recently used item.
        :param key: Key to insert or update.
        :param value: Value associated with the key.
        """
        if key in self.cache:
            # If key exists, update it and mark as recently used.
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        
        # Check if the cache exceeds the capacity
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            # popitem(last=False) pops the first item inserted, which is the least recently used.
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an LRU Cache with capacity 2
    lru_cache = LRUCache(2)
    
    lru_cache.put(1, 1)  # Cache is {1: 1}
    lru_cache.put(2, 2)  # Cache is {1: 1, 2: 2}
    print(lru_cache.get(1))  # Returns 1 and updates usage order; Cache becomes {2: 2, 1: 1}
    
    lru_cache.put(3, 3)  # Evicts key 2; Cache is {1: 1, 3: 3}
    print(lru_cache.get(2))  # Returns -1 (not found)
    
    lru_cache.put(4, 4)  # Evicts key 1; Cache is {3: 3, 4: 4}
    print(lru_cache.get(1))  # Returns -1 (not found)
    print(lru_cache.get(3))  # Returns 3
    print(lru_cache.get(4))  # Returns 4
```

| get(2)          | Lookup key 2, not found (-1)            | {1: 1, 3: 3}                               |
| put(4, 4)       | Insert key 4, evict least used (key 1)  | {3: 3, 4: 4}                               |

## 6. Testing the Implementation
The "Example Usage" section provided above demonstrates how to instantiate an LRUCache, add elements, and retrieve them while automatically handling eviction per the LRU policy.

This implementation leverages the efficient O(1) time complexity for the primary operations (`get` and `put`), thanks to the underlying `OrderedDict`.

Feel free to further test and modify the implementation according to your needs!
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and implementation of a function to check whether a binary tree is balanced. A binary tree is defined as balanced if for every node in the tree, the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees is at most 1.

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Defining “Balanced”**  
   A tree is balanced when, for every node,  
   |height(left subtree) − height(right subtree)| ≤ 1.  
   This means the left and right subtree heights cannot differ by more than one.

2. **Recursive Approach**  
   We can use recursion to compute the height of each subtree while simultaneously checking for balance.  
   - **Base Case:** If the current node is `None` (i.e., an empty tree), its height is 0, and it is trivially balanced.  
   - **Recursive Case:** For a given node, we first compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
     - If either subtree is unbalanced (we can signal this by returning a special value, e.g., `-1`), we immediately propagate that information upward.
     - Then, if the absolute difference of the two subtree heights is more than 1, the current subtree is unbalanced, so we return `-1`.
     - Otherwise, we return the height of the current node as `max(left_height, right_height) + 1`.

3. **Helper Function**  
   Creating a helper function (often called `check_balance`) that returns:
   - A non-negative integer representing the height if the subtree is balanced.
   - `-1` if the subtree is not balanced.
   
4. **Main Function**  
   The main function will simply invoke the helper function on the root of the tree. If the helper returns `-1`, then the tree is not balanced; otherwise, it is balanced.

---

## Python Implementation

Below is the complete Python code for checking if a binary tree is balanced:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_balanced(root):
    """
    Check if a binary tree is balanced.
    
    :param root: TreeNode, the root of the binary tree.
    :return: bool, True if the tree is balanced, False otherwise.
    """
    # Helper function that returns the height if the subtree is balanced,
    # or -1 if it is not balanced.
    def check_balance(node):
        # Base case: an empty node is balanced with a height of 0
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        left_height = check_balance(node.left)
        # If the left subtree is unbalanced, propagate the failure upward.
        if left_height == -1:
            return -1
        
        right_height = check_balance(node.right)
        # If the right subtree is unbalanced, propagate the failure upward.
        if right_height == -1:
            return -1
        
        # If the current node is unbalanced, return -1.
        if abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:
            return -1
        
        # Otherwise, return the height of the current node.
        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1
    
    # Call the helper function on the root.
    return check_balance(root) != -1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Constructing a simple balanced binary tree:
    #        1
    #       / \
    #      2   3
    #     /
    #    4
    node4 = TreeNode(4)
    node2 = TreeNode(2, left=node4)
    node3 = TreeNode(3)
    node1 = TreeNode(1, left=node2, right=node3)
    
    print("Is the tree balanced?", is_balanced(node1))  # Expected output: True
```

---

## Explanation of the Code:

- **TreeNode Class:**  
  A simple class representing a node in the binary tree. Each node holds a `value` and pointers to left and right children.

- **is_balanced Function:**  
  This function acts as the main entry point. It utilizes an inner helper function `check_balance`.

- **check_balance Function:**  
  - *Base Case:* Returns `0` if the current node is `None`.
  - *Recursive Checks:* Acquires the heights of the left and right subtrees.
  - *Balance Check:* If the absolute difference between the left and right subtree heights exceeds 1, the function returns `-1` immediately indicating imbalance.
  - *Height Computation:* Otherwise, returns the height of the current node.

- **Usage Example:**  
  The provided example creates a small tree and invokes `is_balanced` to check if it is balanced.

---

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(H) where H is the height of the tree, due to the call stack used in recursion.

This comprehensive solution checks whether a binary tree is balanced and provides clear, step-by-step reasoning alongside a practical Python implementation.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and a complete Python solution for rotating an N×N matrix (2D list) by 90 degrees clockwise in-place.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Understanding the Problem**

When we rotate an N×N matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, each element moves from position (i, j) to (j, N-1-i). However, doing this directly can be challenging to do in-place.

### 2. **Two-Step Strategy**

A common and efficient solution involves two main steps:

- **Transpose the Matrix:**  
  Convert rows to columns by swapping elements at indices (i, j) with those at (j, i).

  **Example:**  
  For the matrix  
  ```
  1   2   3
  4   5   6
  7   8   9
  ```  
  After transposition, it becomes:  
  ```
  1   4   7
  2   5   8
  3   6   9
  ```

- **Reverse Each Row:**  
  To complete the 90-degree clockwise rotation, reverse every row of the transposed matrix.

  **Example:**  
  After reversing each row in the transposed matrix:  
  ```
  7   4   1
  8   5   2
  9   6   3
  ```  
  This is the matrix rotated by 90 degrees.

### 3. **Detailed Code Implementation**

Below is a Python code snippet that performs these two steps, thereby rotating the matrix in-place:

```python
def rotate_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates the given N x N matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place.
    """
    n = len(matrix)
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i]
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    
    print("Original Matrix:")
    for row in matrix:
        print(row)
    
    rotate_matrix(matrix)
    
    print("\nRotated Matrix:")
    for row in matrix:
        print(row)
```

### 4. **Explanation of the Code**

- **Transposition Loop:**  
  - The outer loop runs over each row index `i`.
  - The inner loop runs over column indices `j` starting from `i + 1` to ensure that each pair is swapped only once and not unnecessarily swapped back.
  
- **Reversal Loop:**  
  - We call `.reverse()` on each row, which is an in-place operation in Python.

### 5. **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - The transposition step takes O(n²) time.
  - Reversing each of the n rows takes O(n) each, for a total of O(n²).
  - Overall time complexity is O(n²).

- **Space Complexity:**  
  - The operation is done in-place, so the extra space is O(1) (aside from input storage).

---

## Conclusion

By transposing the matrix followed by reversing each row, we can efficiently rotate an N×N matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place. This method avoids the need for additional memory allocation and is both intuitive and performant for this well-known problem.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation of how to find the longest palindromic substring using Manacher’s algorithm, which runs in O(n) time. The explanation is broken down into clear steps along with Python code.

---

## Step 1. The Problem Recap

**Goal:**  
Given a string S, we need to find the longest contiguous substring that is a palindrome. A naive approach takes O(n²) or worse time. The optimal solution uses Manacher’s algorithm, which finds the longest palindromic substring in O(n) time.

---

## Step 2. Preprocessing the Input String

Manacher’s algorithm works uniformly on both odd- and even-length palindromes by inserting a special character such as “#” between every adjacent pair of characters (and at the ends). This ensures that every palindrome in the modified string has an odd length. 

For example:  
- Original: "abba"  
- Processed: "^#a#b#b#a#$"  
Here, "^" and "$" are added to prevent bounds checking.

**Reasoning:**  
- The “#” characters ensure that even-length palindromes are transformed into odd length ones.
- Sentinel characters "^" and "$" prevent index overflow during the expansion.

---

## Step 3. The Core Algorithm

### Variables:
- Let P be an array that will hold the length of the palindrome radius (not including the center) around each center position in the processed string.
- Let C be the center of the current right-most palindrome.
- Let R be the right boundary (exclusive) of the current right-most palindrome.

### Iterative Steps:
1. **Mirror Calculation:**  
   For each position i, find i's mirror about C (i.e., mirror = 2*C - i).  
   If i is inside the current palindrome (i < R), initialize P[i] as the minimum of (R - i) and P[mirror].

2. **Expansion:**  
   Attempt to expand the palindrome centered at i by comparing characters at positions (i + P[i] + 1) and (i - P[i] - 1) until they differ. Increase P[i] with each successful expansion.

3. **Update Center and Right Boundary:**  
   If the palindrome at i extends past R, update C to i and R to i + P[i].

4. **Tracking the Maximum Palindrome:**  
   Keep track of the position that yields the maximum P[i] as the longest palindromic substring.

---

## Step 4. Implementation in Python

Below is an annotated Python implementation using Manacher’s algorithm:

```python
def longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:
    # Preprocess the string to handle even-length palindromes uniformly.
    def preprocess(s):
        # Insert '#' between characters and add sentinels.
        if not s:
            return "^$"
        T = "^"
        for char in s:
            T += "#" + char
        T += "#$"
        return T

    T = preprocess(s)
    n = len(T)
    P = [0] * n  # Array to store palindrome radius lengths.
    C = 0  # Center of the current right-most palindrome.
    R = 0  # Right boundary of the current right-most palindrome.

    # Loop through the transformed string, ignoring the boundary characters.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        # Find the mirror of i with respect to center C.
        mirror = 2 * C - i
        
        # If within the current palindrome, use the minimum of mirror's palindrome or the remaining span.
        if i < R:
            P[i] = min(R - i, P[mirror])
        else:
            P[i] = 0  # Reset P[i] if i is outside the current known palindrome.

        # Expand around center i.
        while T[i + 1 + P[i]] == T[i - 1 - P[i]]:
            P[i] += 1

        # If palindrome centered at i expands past R, update center C and boundary R.
        if i + P[i] > R:
            C = i
            R = i + P[i]

    # Find the maximum element in P.
    max_len = 0
    center_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if P[i] > max_len:
            max_len = P[i]
            center_index = i

    # Compute starting index in the original string.
    start = (center_index - max_len) // 2  # Adjust for the '#' characters.
    return s[start: start + max_len]


# Testing the function:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_strings = [
        "babad",
        "cbbd",
        "a",
        "ac",
        "forgeeksskeegfor"
    ]
    for s in test_strings:
        result = longest_palindromic_substring(s)
        print(f"Longest palindromic substring in '{s}' is: '{result}'")
```

---

## Step 5. Explanation of Key Details

- **Preprocessing Function:**  
  The function `preprocess(s)` builds a new string where each character of the original string is separated by a “#”, and the string is wrapped with sentinel characters "^" and "$".

- **Array P:**  
  P[i] holds the radius (half-length) of the palindrome centered at T[i] (not counting T[i] itself). This allows the algorithm to avoid re-checking characters that are already known to be palindromic.

- **Updating C and R:**  
  If the newly expanded palindrome centered at i extends beyond the current right boundary R, the algorithm updates C (the center) and R (the right boundary). This is key to ensuring that the algorithm runs in O(n) time, as it uses previously computed information to skip unnecessary comparisons.

- **Mapping Back to the Original String:**  
  The computed center index in the transformed string is converted back to an index in the original string by accounting for the inserted characters.

---

## Step 6. Conclusion

Manacher’s algorithm offers an optimal O(n) solution for finding the longest palindromic substring in a string. The detailed walkthrough above explains each stage of the algorithm from preprocessing the input, the expansion process, and tracking the palindrome lengths, down to the final mapping to obtain the substring from the original string.

This solution is both efficient and elegant, managing to solve a challenging problem by leveraging symmetry and dynamic programming techniques.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation of Kadane’s algorithm for solving the maximum subarray problem, along with a complete Python implementation.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Problem Statement

Given an array of integers (which can be positive, negative, or zero), the goal is to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

### 2. Kadane’s Algorithm Overview

Kadane's algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming method that runs in O(n) time. It works by keeping track of two values as it traverses the array:

- **current_max:** the maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current index.
- **global_max:** the maximum sum encountered so far across any subarray.

### 3. Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set both `current_max` and `global_max` to the first element of the array. This is based on the premise that at the very least, the maximum sum is the first element.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each element in the array (starting from the second element), update `current_max` as the maximum of the current element and the sum of `current_max` and the current element. This decides whether to:
     - Start a new subarray at the current element.
     - Or continue with the previous subarray by adding the current element.
   - Update `global_max` if `current_max` exceeds the present `global_max`.

3. **Result:**
   - At the end of the iteration, `global_max` holds the maximum subarray sum.

### 4. Python Code Implementation

Below is the Python implementation of Kadane’s algorithm:

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    # Edge case: if the list is empty, return 0 (or raise an error depending on requirements)
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Initialize current_max and global_max with the first element of the array.
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]

    # Iterate over the array starting from index 1
    for index, num in enumerate(nums[1:], start=1):
        # Decide whether to add current element to the existing subarray or start a new subarray
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)

        # If current_max increases the global maximum found so far, update global_max
        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
        
        # Debug print (optional): Uncomment the following line for step-by-step tracing:
        # print(f"Index {index}: num = {num}, current_max = {current_max}, global_max = {global_max}")
    
    return global_max

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test array
    test_nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
    result = max_subarray(test_nums)
    print("The maximum subarray sum is:", result)
```

---

## Code Walkthrough

- **Initialization:**
  ```python
  current_max = global_max = nums[0]
  ```
  This sets the starting point based on the first element.

- **Main Loop (Iteration through the array):**
  ```python
  for index, num in enumerate(nums[1:], start=1):
      current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
      global_max = max(global_max, current_max)
  ```
  - At each step, decide whether to begin a new subarray with the current number or extend the existing subarray.
  - Update the `global_max` to remember the best sum found.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  The function checks if the input list is empty and returns 0. This behavior can be adjusted based on how you want to handle empty inputs.

- **Example Usage:**
  The main block demonstrates how to use the function with an example list.

### Complexity Analysis

| Complexity Measure | Value        |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Time Complexity    | O(n)         |
| Space Complexity   | O(1)         |

- **Time Complexity:** Only one pass through the array is needed.
- **Space Complexity:** The space required is constant since only a few variables are used.

### Equation Representation

At each element i, the recurrence relation is:
  
  current_max[i] = max( nums[i], current_max[i-1] + nums[i] )
  
  global_max = max( global_max, current_max[i] )

    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

This graph means:
- Node 'A' is connected to 'B' and 'C'
- Node 'B' is connected to 'D' and 'E'
- Node 'C' is connected to 'F', and so on.

## 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Explanation

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented either recursively or iteratively (using a stack). Below is a recursive implementation.

#### Steps:
1. **Start at the root node**: Mark it as visited.
2. **Explore each neighbor of the current node**:
   - For each unvisited neighbor, recursively perform DFS.
3. **Backtrack**: Once all neighbors are visited, return.

### Implementation

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    """
    Perform a Depth-First Search starting from the 'start' node.
    
    Parameters:
    - graph (dict): The graph represented as an adjacency list.
    - start (Any): The starting node.
    - visited (set): A set to keep track of visited nodes.
    
    Returns:
    - visited (set): The set of visited nodes.
    """
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()     # Initialize the visited set on the first call
    
    visited.add(start)      # Mark the current node as visited
    print(start, end=' ')   # Process the node (printing in this case)
    
    # Recursively visit all unvisited neighbors
    for neighbor in graph.get(start, []):
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    
    return visited

# Example Usage:
print("DFS Traversal:")
dfs(graph, 'A')
print()  # for a new line
```

---

## 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

### Explanation

BFS explores the graph level by level using a queue to keep track of the next nodes to visit.

#### Steps:
1. **Start at the root node**: Enqueue the starting node.
2. **Process the queue**:
   - Dequeue the current node and mark it as visited (if not already).
   - Enqueue all unvisited neighbors.
3. **Repeat** until the queue is empty.

### Implementation

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    """
    Perform a Breadth-First Search starting from the 'start' node.
    
    Parameters:
    - graph (dict): The graph represented as an adjacency list.
    - start (Any): The starting node.
    
    Returns:
    - visited_order (list): The list of nodes in the order they were visited.
    """
    visited = set()           # Set to track visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])    # Initialize queue with the starting node
    visited.add(start)
    visited_order = []        # List to record the order of traversal
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()      # Dequeue the current node
        visited_order.append(node)  # Process the node (record order or print it)
        print(node, end=' ')
        
        # Enqueue all unvisited neighbors
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited_order

# Example Usage:
print("BFS Traversal:")
bfs(graph, 'A')
print()  # for a new line
```

---

## 5. Summary

- **DFS** uses recursion (or an explicit stack) to traverse deep before backtracking.
- **BFS** uses a queue to process nodes level by level.
- Both algorithms maintain a "visited" set to avoid processing nodes more than once.

The provided code snippets serve as a basic implementation of each search algorithm for a graph represented as an adjacency list. You can modify these functions to suit specific needs such as returning paths or detecting cycles.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation of one of the most common methods to detect a cycle in a linked list—**Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm** (also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm).

---

## Detailed Approach Using Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm

### 1. Intuition

- **The Problem:**  
  A cycle occurs in a linked list when a node's next pointer points to a previous node in the list (thus forming a loop).

- **The Insight:**  
  Use two pointers:
  - **Slow Pointer (Tortoise):** Moves one step at a time.
  - **Fast Pointer (Hare):** Moves two steps at a time.
  
  If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer (i.e., both pointers will reference the same node). If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (i.e., a null reference).

### 2. Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization:**  
   Set both slow and fast pointers to the head of the list.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Move the slow pointer one node at a time.
   - Move the fast pointer two nodes at a time.
   
3. **Cycle Check:**
   - **If at any point the fast pointer or its next node is null:**  
     The list has no cycle.  
   - **If the slow pointer equals the fast pointer:**  
     A cycle exists.

### 3. Pseudocode

Below is a pseudocode representation of the algorithm:

```plaintext
function hasCycle(head):
    if head is null:
        return false
    
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    while fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
        slow = slow.next           // Move slow pointer by one step.
        fast = fast.next.next      // Move fast pointer by two steps.

        if slow == fast:
            return true          // Cycle detected!

    return false                 // No cycle found.
```

### 4. Python Code Example

Here's a Python snippet demonstrating the algorithm:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def has_cycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False

    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next          # Move one step.
        fast = fast.next.next     # Move two steps.

        if slow == fast:
            return True         # Cycle detected!
    
    return False                # No cycle.

# Example usage:
# Create a linked list with a cycle for testing
node1 = ListNode(1)
node2 = ListNode(2)
node3 = ListNode(3)
node4 = ListNode(4)

node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3
node3.next = node4
node4.next = node2  # Creates a cycle linking back to node2

print(has_cycle(node1))  # Output should be True
```

### 5. Complexity Analysis

| Aspect            | Analysis        |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n) - In the worst case, both pointers traverse all nodes. |
| **Space Complexity**| O(1) - Only a few pointers are used, regardless of list size. |

### 6. Alternative Method Using a Hash Table

An alternative approach is to keep track of visited nodes using a hash set:

- **Algorithm:**  
  Traverse the linked list and add each node to a hash set. If a node is encountered that is already in the set, a cycle exists.
  
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n)
  - Space: O(n)

**Example:**

```python
def has_cycle_hash(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    seen_nodes = set()
    while head:
        if head in seen_nodes:
            return True  # Cycle detected!
        seen_nodes.add(head)
        head = head.next
    return False
```

---

## Summary

To detect a cycle in a linked list efficiently, **Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm** is typically preferred due to its O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. The algorithm works by using two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds; if the fast pointer catches up with the slow pointer, a cycle is present.

This detailed explanation outlines the reasoning, provides pseudocode and Python code examples, and contrasts the approach with an alternative method using a hash table.
# Answer

Below is a detailed Python implementation of a **singly linked list**. In this solution, we’ll build the Node and LinkedList classes, and include key methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and search. Additionally, I’ll explain each step and provide sample usage.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Define the Node Class
- **Purpose:**  
  Each node in a linked list holds data and a pointer (reference) to the next node.
- **Attributes:**  
  - `data`: The value stored in the node.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the list.

### 2. Define the LinkedList Class
- **Purpose:**  
  Manages nodes remembering the head (first node) of the list.
- **Key Methods:**
  - **insert_at_beginning(data):**  
    Creates a new node, and places it at the beginning.
  - **insert_at_end(data):**  
    Traverses to the end and appends the new node.
  - **delete_node(key):**  
    Searches for a node with a specified value (`key`) and deletes it.
  - **search(key):**  
    Traverses the list to find a node with a specified value.
  - **traverse():**  
    Iterates through the list and collects node values (useful for display).

### 3. Code Implementation

Below is the complete code implementation:

```python
# Node class for our Linked List
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Store the data
        self.next = None  # Pointer to next node


# LinkedList class to manage the nodes
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Initially, the list is empty

    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        """Insert a node at the beginning of the list."""
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head  # New node points to the former head
        self.head = new_node       # Update the head to the new node

    def insert_at_end(self, data):
        """Insert a node at the end of the list."""
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:      # If list is empty, new node becomes head
            self.head = new_node
            return
        # Otherwise, traverse to the end of the list
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node       # Append the new node

    def delete_node(self, key):
        """
        Delete the first occurrence of key in linked list.
        key: The value to be deleted from the list.
        """
        temp = self.head

        # Check if head node itself holds the key to be deleted
        if temp and temp.data == key:
            self.head = temp.next  # Change head to next node
            temp = None
            return

        # Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of previous node
        prev = None
        while temp and temp.data != key:
            prev = temp
            temp = temp.next

        # If key was not present in linked list
        if temp is None:
            print(f"Value {key} not found in the list.")
            return

        # Unlink the node from the linked list
        prev.next = temp.next
        temp = None

    def search(self, key):
        """Search for the first occurrence of key in the list."""
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.data == key:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

    def traverse(self):
        """Traverse the list and collect all values in a python list."""
        elements = []
        current = self.head
        while current:
            elements.append(current.data)
            current = current.next
        return elements

    def __str__(self):
        """For easy printing of the list."""
        return " -> ".join(str(item) for item in self.traverse())


# Example usage of the LinkedList:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of LinkedList
    ll = LinkedList()

    # Insert elements at beginning and at end
    ll.insert_at_beginning(10)
    ll.insert_at_beginning(20)
    ll.insert_at_end(30)
    ll.insert_at_end(40)

    print("Initial Linked List:")
    print(ll)  # Expected Output: 20 -> 10 -> 30 -> 40

    # Search for a value
    value_to_search = 30
    if ll.search(value_to_search):
        print(f"Value {value_to_search} found in the list!")
    else:
        print(f"Value {value_to_search} not found in the list.")

    # Delete a node from the list
    print("Deleting value 10 from the list.")
    ll.delete_node(10)
    print("Linked List after deletion:")
    print(ll)  # Expected Output: 20 -> 30 -> 40
```

## Explanation of the Code Snippet

1. **Node Class:**
   - The `__init__` method initializes the node with its data and sets `next` to `None`.

2. **LinkedList Class:**
   - The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the `head` as `None`.
   - `insert_at_beginning`: Creates a new node and makes it the new head of the list.
   - `insert_at_end`: Traverses the list until the end and appends the new node.
   - `delete_node`: Handles both edge cases where the node to delete is the head or some other node.
   - `search`: Iterates through the list to find a node with the given key, returning `True` if found.
   - `traverse`: Collects and returns all the node data values in a Python list.
   - `__str__`: Provides a convenient string representation for printing the list.

3. **Sample Usage:**
   - The code block under `if __name__ == "__main__":` allows you to test the linked list functionality:
     - Inserting nodes at the beginning and end.
     - Searching for a specific node.
     - Deleting a node.
     - Printing the list.

This implementation forms a basis for a linked list in Python and can be extended to include additional features such as inserting at a specific index, reversing the list, etc. Enjoy experimenting and extending the code as needed!
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation of how to reverse a string or a list in-place (when applicable), along with code examples and explanations.

---

## 1. Reversing a List In-Place

### Explanation

- **Mutability:**  
  Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can change their contents without creating a new list. This makes it possible to reverse them in-place.

- **Built-In Method:**  
  Python provides the `reverse()` method for lists, which modifies the list in place without creating a new list object.

- **Manual Approach:**  
  Alternatively, you can use a two-pointer approach to swap elements from the ends of the list, moving toward the center. This is useful if you wish to understand or implement the reverse logic manually.

### Code Examples

#### Using `list.reverse()`

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Using Two-Pointer Swapping

```python
def reverse_list_in_place(lst):
    left = 0
    right = len(lst) - 1
    while left < right:
        lst[left], lst[right] = lst[right], lst[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reverse_list_in_place(my_list)
print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Explanation of Two-Pointer Swapping

- **Step 1:** Initialize two pointers, `left` (starting at index 0) and `right` (starting at the last index).
- **Step 2:** Swap the items at these indices.
- **Step 3:** Move `left` pointer one step forward and `right` one step backward.
- **Step 4:** Continue until the two pointers meet or cross.

| Step             | left index | right index | List State                     |
|------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Initial State    | 0          | 4           | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                |
| After 1st Swap   | 1          | 3           | [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]                |
| After 2nd Swap   | 2          | 2           | [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]                |
| Termination      | —          | —           | [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]                |

---

## 2. Reversing a String In-Place

### Explanation

- **Immutability:**  
  In Python, strings are immutable. This means you cannot modify them in place. Instead, you have to create a new string that is the reverse of the original.

- **Common Technique:**  
  A common and Pythonic way to reverse a string is to use slicing with a step of `-1`.

### Code Example

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)  # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
```

#### Explanation of Slicing Technique

- **Slice Notation:**  
  `string[start:stop:step]` allows slicing of a string. By omitting `start` and `stop` and setting `step` to `-1`, you traverse the string in reverse order, creating a new reversed string.

---

## Summary

- **Lists:** Use the built-in `reverse()` method or implement a two-pointer method to reverse the list in place.
- **Strings:** Since strings are immutable, you cannot reverse them in place; instead, use slicing (`[::-1]`) to create a new reversed string.

This approach provides both high-level built-in methods and a deeper understanding of the manual algorithm for in-place reversal.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and a Python implementation of a function that finds the first non-repeating character in a string.

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem:**

   We need to process a string to determine which character appears only once and, among those, return the first one in the order of the string. If every character repeats, a signal (such as `None` or an appropriate message) should be returned.

2. **Choosing an Approach:**

   - **Counting Frequencies:**  
     Use a hashing mechanism (like a Python dictionary) to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
     
   - **Identify the First Unique Character:**  
     After counting, iterate over the string from the beginning and check which character has a frequency of 1. That will be our first non-repeating character.

3. **Algorithm Complexity:**

   - **Time Complexity:**  
     Counting the characters is an O(n) operation, and then scanning again is another O(n) operation. Thus, the overall complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
     
   - **Space Complexity:**  
     Additional space is used to store the character counts (a dictionary with at most n elements). This gives O(n) space complexity.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**

   - **Empty String:**  
     If the string is empty, immediately return an indicator (like `None` or an empty string).
     
   - **No Unique Character:**  
     If the string has no non-repeating characters, return a value that indicates this (for example, `None`).

5. **Testing the Function:**

   It is useful to test the function with various inputs:
   
   | Input      | Expected Output | Explanation                                     |
   |------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
   | "leetcode" | "l"             | "l" is the first character that does not repeat.|
   | "aabbcc"   | None            | All characters repeat.                         |
   | ""         | None            | Edge case: empty string.                       |

---

## Python Implementation

Below is the Python code using the reasoning above:

```python
def first_non_repeating_char(s):
    """
    Returns the first non-repeating character in the given string `s`.
    If no such character exists, returns None.
    """
    # Edge case: if the string is empty, return None
    if not s:
        return None

    char_count = {}

    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1

    # Step 2: Identify the first character with a count of 1
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char

    # If every character repeats, return None
    return None

# Testing the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [
        ("leetcode", "l"),
        ("loveleetcode", "v"),
        ("aabbcc", None),
        ("", None)
    ]
    
    for s, expected in test_cases:
        result = first_non_repeating_char(s)
        print(f"For input: '{s}' => First non-repeating character: {result} (Expected: {expected})")
```

---

## Explanation of the Code

- **Counting Frequencies:**  
  We iterate through each character in the string `s` and update its count in the `char_count` dictionary.

- **Finding the First Unique Character:**  
  We then iterate over the string once again. For the first character where `char_count[char]` equals 1, we immediately return that character.

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - If the string is empty, the condition `if not s` handles it.
  - If no non-repeating character is found (i.e., all characters have a count greater than 1), the function returns `None`.

- **Testing:**  
  A simple test driver is included under the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, where a few test cases are run to validate the correctness of the function.

---

This detailed explanation and implementation should help you understand both the reasoning and the code needed to solve the problem of finding the first non-repeating character in a string.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation of time complexity for common operations on Python’s data structures, using a chain-of-thought approach to break down the reasoning step by step.

---

## 1. Python Lists

Python lists are dynamic arrays that support random access and efficient appends. Let’s discuss two common operations:

### A. Appending to a List  
- **Operation**: `list.append(item)`
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (amortized)
- **Explanation**:  
  - When you append an item, if there is available space in the underlying array, the item is simply placed at the next free position—a constant time operation.
  - Occasionally, if the list is full, a reallocation is required—this involves allocating a larger array and copying the elements over. Although this reallocation takes O(n) time, it happens infrequently enough that the **amortized** cost of appending remains O(1).

### B. Inserting at Index 0  
- **Operation**: `list.insert(0, item)`
- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**
- **Explanation**:  
  - Inserting at the beginning requires shifting all existing elements one position to the right to make room for the new element.
  - The number of shifts is proportional to the size of the list (n), hence the operation takes linear time.

---

## 2. Other Python Data Structures

While lists are among the most commonly used structures, it is useful to understand the time complexities for operations on dictionaries and sets as well.

### A. Dictionaries  
- **Access/Lookup**: **O(1)** average-case  
  - Python dictionaries are implemented as hash tables.
- **Insertion/Update**: **O(1)** average-case  
- **Deletion**: **O(1)** average-case  
- **Worst-case**: In rare situations (typically due to hash collisions), operations can degenerate towards O(n), but Python’s hash function and table resizing minimize this likelihood.

### B. Sets  
- **Insertion and Membership Testing**: **O(1)** average-case  
  - Like dictionaries, sets use hash tables.
- **Deletion**: **O(1)** average-case

### C. Tuples  
- **Immutability**: Since tuples are immutable, operations like appending aren’t supported.  
- **Access**: **O(1)**
- **Creation**: Taking time linear to the number of elements when constructing a new tuple.

### D. Deques (from collections module)  
- **Appending/appending left**: **O(1)**  
- **Popping/popping left**: **O(1)**
- **Random Access**: Not as efficient as lists since deques are implemented as doubly-linked lists of fixed-size blocks.

## 3. Summary Table of Time Complexities

Below is a summary table that compares the time complexities of various operations.

| Data Structure | Operation                  | Time Complexity | Explanation                                                                                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **List**       | Append                     | O(1) amortized  | Occasional resizing leads to O(n) cost, but infrequent enough to average out to O(1).                          |
| **List**       | Insert at beginning (index 0)| O(n)           | Requires shifting all elements to the right.                                                                  |
| **List**       | Random Access              | O(1)            | Direct access via index.                                                                                        |
| **Dict**       | Insert/Lookup/Deletion     | O(1) average    | Implemented as hash tables.                                                                                    |
| **Set**        | Insertion/Membership       | O(1) average    | Also hash-table based.                                                                                         |
| **Tuple**      | Access                     | O(1)            | Similar to lists for indexing, but tuples are immutable.                                                       |
| **Deque**      | Append/Pop (both ends)     | O(1)            | Designed for efficient additions and removals at both ends.                                                   |
| **Deque**      | Random Access              | O(n)            | Not optimized for random access like lists.                                                                    |

## 4. Code Snippets for Illustration

Here are small code examples to illustrate how these operations behave:

### Appending to a List
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # O(1) amortized
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Inserting at the Beginning of a List
```python
my_list = [2, 3, 4]
my_list.insert(0, 1)  # O(n), as it shifts elements
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Dictionary Operations
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
# Lookup
value = my_dict['a']  # O(1) average
# Insertion
my_dict['c'] = 3      # O(1) average
print(my_dict)
```

### Set Operations
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
# Insertion
my_set.add(4)  # O(1) average
# Membership Test
print(3 in my_set)  # O(1) average
```

## 5. Conclusion

Understanding the time complexities helps in choosing the right data structure for a given problem:
- Use **list.append()** when you need quick additions to the end of a list (O(1) amortized).
- Avoid **list.insert(0, item)** for frequent insertions at the beginning if the list is large, or consider a **deque** which supports O(1) operations at both ends.

By matching the right data structure with your performance needs, you ensure that your code runs efficiently.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and step-by-step approach to efficiently merge two sorted lists into one sorted list, along with supporting code and examples.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize Pointers**  
   - Let List A and List B be the two sorted lists.
   - Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0. These pointers track the current index of List A and List B respectively.
   - Initialize an empty list, say List C, which will store the merged sorted list.

2. **Compare and Merge**  
   - While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists:
     - Compare the elements at List A[i] and List B[j].
     - Append the smaller element to List C.
     - Increment the pointer in the list from which the element was taken.
   - This ensures that at each step, the smallest remaining element from the two lists is added to List C, maintaining sorted order.

3. **Append Remaining Elements**  
   - After the loop, one of the lists may still have remaining elements.
   - Append all the remaining elements from List A (if any) to List C.
   - Append all the remaining elements from List B (if any) to List C.

4. **Return or Use the Merged List**  
   - The resulting List C is now a merged sorted list containing all the elements from List A and List B.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m)  
  Since each element of both lists is visited exactly once, where n and m are the sizes of List A and List B respectively.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m)  
  Additional space is required for the merged list if a new list is returned.

---

## Example Code in Python

Below is a Python implementation of the above procedure:

```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list_a, list_b):
    # Initialize pointers for both lists
    i, j = 0, 0
    merged_list = []
    
    # Compare elements from both lists and merge them in sorted order
    while i < len(list_a) and j < len(list_b):
        if list_a[i] <= list_b[j]:
            merged_list.append(list_a[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_list.append(list_b[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Append remaining elements from list_a, if any
    while i < len(list_a):
        merged_list.append(list_a[i])
        i += 1
    
    # Append remaining elements from list_b, if any
    while j < len(list_b):
        merged_list.append(list_b[j])
        j += 1
    
    return merged_list

# Example usage:
list_a = [1, 3, 5, 7]
list_b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print("Merged List:", merge_sorted_lists(list_a, list_b))
```

**Output:**
```
Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## Conclusion

The above method, using two pointers to traverse each list, is the most efficient way to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. It achieves linear time complexity relative to the total number of elements, making it optimal for this task.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and implementation for solving the two-sum problem in optimal O(n) time using a hash table (dictionary). The idea is to traverse the array once, storing each number along with its index in a hash table, and for each number, checking if its complement (target - current number) exists in the hash table.

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Problem Understanding**  
   We are given:
   - An array of integers, e.g., nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
   - A target integer, e.g., target = 9  
   
   Our task is to find two distinct indices i and j such that:  
   
   num[i] + num[j] = target.

2. **Optimal Approach (Hash Table)**  
   - **Idea:** While traversing the array, compute the complement of the current element.  
   - **Hash Table:** Use a dictionary to store numbers as keys and their indices as values.  
   - **Check Complement:** For each element `num` at index `i`, compute `complement = target - num`. Check if `complement` exists in the dictionary.  
     - If yes, then we found the pair, so return their indices.  
     - If no, add `num` with its index to the dictionary for subsequent checks.

3. **Time Complexity Analysis**  
   - You go through the array just once: O(n) time.
   - Dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average, making it an optimal solution.

4. **Example Walkthrough**  
   Consider nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9:
   - **Iteration 1:**  
     - num = 2, index = 0  
     - complement = 9 - 2 = 7  
     - 7 is not in the dictionary. Add {2: 0}.
   - **Iteration 2:**  
     - num = 7, index = 1  
     - complement = 9 - 7 = 2  
     - 2 is in the dictionary (from iteration 1).  
     - Return [0, 1] as the indices.

5. **Implementation in Python**

Below is a Python implementation with detailed comments:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Dictionary to keep track of numbers and their indices
    num_to_index = {}
    
    # Traverse through the list
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement that would add up to target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement exists in our dictionary
        if complement in num_to_index:
            # If found, return the pair of indices
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        
        # Otherwise, store the current number and its index in the dictionary
        num_to_index[num] = i
    
    # If no valid pair is found, return None or raise an error as needed.
    return None

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print("Indices:", result)  # Output should be: Indices: [0, 1]
```

---

## Summary

- **Algorithm:** Use one pass of the list with a hash table to record seen numbers.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) due to a single traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to storing elements in the hash table.

This approach is both optimal and concise for solving the two-sum problem.
# Answer

Below is a detailed explanation and implementation of a binary search algorithm on a sorted list, presented in a step-by-step format.

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**  
   - We need to search for a specific target value in a sorted list.
   - Binary search works by comparing the target with the middle element of the list.
   - Since the list is sorted, we can determine which half of the list the target must lie in:
     - **If the target is equal to the middle element**, we have found the index.
     - **If the target is greater than the middle element**, search the right half.
     - **If the target is less than the middle element**, search the left half.

2. **Algorithm Outline**  
   - **Initialize Pointers:**  
     Set `low` to the start index (0) and `high` to the end index (`len(list) - 1`).
   - **Loop Until the Target is Found or the Range is Exhausted:**  
     - While `low <= high`:
       - Compute the middle index: `mid = (low + high) // 2`
       - **Compare:**
         - If `sorted_list[mid] == target`, return `mid`.
         - If `sorted_list[mid] < target`, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
         - Otherwise, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - **Conclusion:**
     - If the loop ends with no match, return an indication (for example, `-1`) that the target is not present.

3. **Complexity Analysis**  
   - **Time Complexity:** O(log n) because the search space is halved with each step.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) since the algorithm uses only a few extra variables.

4. **Implementation in Python**

Below is the complete Python implementation with comments:

```python
def binary_search(sorted_list, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted list.
    
    Args:
        sorted_list (list): A list of sorted elements
        target (any): The element to search for
        
    Returns:
        int: The index of target in sorted_list if found, otherwise -1.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(sorted_list) - 1

    # Loop until the range is exhausted
    while low <= high:
        # Calculate mid index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        print(f"Checking middle index {mid}: {sorted_list[mid]}")  # Debug output

        # Check if the target is found
        if sorted_list[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif sorted_list[mid] < target:
            # Target is in the right half of the list
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # Target is in the left half of the list
            high = mid - 1

    # Target not found in the sorted list
    return -1

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
    target = 7
    result = binary_search(sorted_list, target)
    
    if result != -1:
        print(f"Target {target} found at index: {result}")
    else:
        print(f"Target {target} not found.")
```

| Step                      | Operation/Explanation                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initialize low and high   | `low = 0`; `high = len(sorted_list) - 1`                   |
| Compute middle index      | `mid = (low + high) // 2`                                   |
| Compare element at mid    | Check if `sorted_list[mid]` equals the target              |
| Adjust search boundary    | If `sorted_list[mid] < target`, set `low = mid + 1`.<br>If `sorted_list[mid] > target`, set `high = mid - 1` |
| Return result             | If element found, return index; else return `-1`            |

### Equations

1. **Middle Index Calculation:**  
   mid = ⌊ (low + high) / 2 ⌋

2. **Conditionals for Adjusting Boundaries:**  
   - If target > sorted_list[mid]: → low = mid + 1  
   - If target < sorted_list[mid]: → high = mid - 1

---

This implementation efficiently finds the target using binary search, leveraging the sorted property of the list to achieve a logarithmic time complexity. You can further test the function with various sorted lists and targets to ensure it covers all edge cases.
