# 🧠 AI & Cloud-Native Development Monorepo

This repository is a unified, modular, and extensible codebase for building intelligent systems using a wide range of **AI models**—including **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Agentic AI**—alongside **cloud-native application development** on **AWS** and **Azure**.

It is designed for developers, researchers, and engineers working on production-grade AI pipelines, experimentation, and microservice-based deployments.
