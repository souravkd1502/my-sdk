Text Anonymization Pipeline using Microsoft Presidio

This module provides a comprehensive, configurable, and scalable solution for anonymizing 
sensitive information (PII, PHI, PCI, etc.) from text transcripts using Microsoft Presidio.

Key Features:
    - Custom pattern recognizers for domain-specific entities (NAME_LETTER, POSTCODE)
    - JSON configuration-driven entity detection for flexible deployment
    - Multiple masking strategies: "stars" (*****), "entity" (<ENTITY_TYPE>), "fixed" ([REDACTED])
    - High-performance concurrent file processing with real-time progress tracking
    - Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and stack traces
    - Intelligent directory structure preservation and automatic output organization
    - Thread-safe operations for production environments

Supported Entity Types:
    - Standard PII: PERSON, EMAIL_ADDRESS, PHONE_NUMBER, US_SSN
    - Financial: CREDIT_CARD
    - Technical: IP_ADDRESS
    - Temporal: DATE_TIME
    - Custom: NAME_LETTER (spell-out names like C-R-I-S), POSTCODE (mixed alphanumeric codes)

Architecture:
    The module follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns:
    1. EntityConfig: Manages entity configuration loading and validation
    2. TextAnonymizer: Handles core anonymization logic with custom recognizers
    3. FileProcessor: Manages file I/O operations and output path generation
    4. BatchProcessor: Orchestrates concurrent processing with validation

Usage Examples:
    Basic usage:
        python pii_detection_with_presidio.py
    
    Programmatic usage:
        from pii_detection_with_presidio import TextAnonymizer, EntityConfig
        
        config = EntityConfig("custom_entities.json")
        anonymizer = TextAnonymizer(config.entities, mask_style="entity")
        result = anonymizer.anonymize_text("Call John Doe at john@email.com")

Performance Considerations:
    - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound operations
    - Configurable worker count (default: 4 threads)
    - Memory-efficient streaming for large files
    - Regex pattern compilation is cached by Presidio

Security Notes:
    - All sensitive data is processed in-memory only
    - Original files are never modified
    - Output directory structure prevents path traversal attacks
    - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

Requirements:
    pip install presidio-analyzer tqdm

class EntityConfig:
    """
    Manages entity configuration for PII detection and anonymization.

    This class provides flexible configuration management for entity types that should be
    detected and anonymized. It supports both JSON file-based configuration and fallback
    to sensible defaults, making it suitable for both development and production environments.

    The configuration approach allows for:
    - Environment-specific entity lists (dev, staging, prod)
    - Runtime entity type management without code changes
    - Easy integration with deployment pipelines
    - Granular control over detection sensitivity

    JSON Configuration Format:
        {
            "entities": [
                "PERSON",           # Names and person identifiers
                "EMAIL_ADDRESS",    # Email addresses
                "CREDIT_CARD",      # Credit card numbers
                "PHONE_NUMBER",     # Phone numbers in various formats
                "DATE_TIME",        # Dates and timestamps
                "IP_ADDRESS",       # IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

# ------------------------- Analyzer Class ------------------------- #
class TextAnonymizer:
    """
    Core text anonymization engine using Microsoft Presidio with custom recognizers.

    This class serves as the central anonymization engine, combining Presidio's built-in
    entity recognition capabilities with custom pattern recognizers for domain-specific
    entities. It provides flexible masking strategies and robust error handling for
    production text processing workflows.

    Key Features:
        - Integration with Presidio's ML-based entity recognition
        - Custom regex-based recognizers for specialized patterns
        - Multiple masking strategies for different use cases
        - Configurable entity detection with confidence scoring
        - Thread-safe operations for concurrent processing
        - Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

    Masking Strategies:
        - "stars": Replace with asterisks matching original length (e.g., "John" â†’ "****")
        - "entity": Replace with entity type in brackets (e.g., "John" â†’ "<PERSON>")
        - "fixed": Replace with fixed redaction marker (e.g., "John" â†’ "[REDACTED]")

    Custom Recognizers:
        - NAME_LETTER: Detects spell-out names (e.g., "C-R-I-S", "J-O-H-N-S-O-N")
        - POSTCODE: Detects alphanumeric postal codes (e.g., "C-A-4-9-D-L", "SW1A-1AA")

    Usage Examples:
        # Basic anonymization with default settings
        anonymizer = TextAnonymizer(["PERSON", "EMAIL_ADDRESS"])
        result = anonymizer.anonymize_text("Contact John Doe at john@email.com")
        
        # Entity-style masking for audit trails
        anonymizer = TextAnonymizer(["PERSON"], mask_style="entity")
        result = anonymizer.anonymize_text("John called")  # â†’ "<PERSON> called"
        
        # Fixed masking for maximum privacy
        anonymizer = TextAnonymizer(["PERSON"], mask_style="fixed")
        result = anonymizer.anonymize_text("John called")  # â†’ "[REDACTED] called"

    Performance Notes:
        - Regex patterns are compiled once during initialization
        - Presidio caching optimizes repeated entity type usage
        - Memory usage scales linearly with text length
        - Processing time depends on text length and entity complexity

    Security Considerations:
        - Original text is never stored or logged
        - Masking is irreversible by design
        - Custom patterns use word boundaries to prevent partial matches
        - Error handling ensures no sensitive data leaks through exceptions

        - Maintain organizational structure in anonymized output
        - Track processing lineage and audit trails
        - Support batch processing across multiple clients/providers
        - Enable parallel processing without conflicts

    Usage Examples:
        # Basic file processing with default output directory
        processor = FileProcessor(anonymizer)
        result = processor.process_file("/path/to/source.txt")
        
        # Custom output directory for organized results
        processor = FileProcessor(anonymizer, output_dir="secure_anonymized")
        result = processor.process_file("/recordings/client1/2023/01/15/call123.txt")

    Thread Safety:
        - Safe for concurrent operation across different files
        - Path operations use atomic directory creation
        - File operations are isolated per processing thread
        - No shared state between processing operations

    Error Handling:
        - Graceful handling of missing files and permissions
        - Detailed error reporting with context preservation
        - No data loss on partial failures
        - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

# ------------------------- Batch Processor Class ------------------------- #
class BatchProcessor:
    """
    Orchestrates high-performance concurrent processing of multiple files with comprehensive validation.

    This class provides the top-level coordination for processing large batches of files through
    the anonymization pipeline. It implements a robust concurrent processing strategy using
    ThreadPoolExecutor, with built-in validation, progress tracking, and comprehensive error
    reporting for production-scale operations.

    Key Features:
        - Concurrent file processing with configurable worker pool
        - Pre-processing validation to avoid wasted resources
        - Real-time progress tracking with visual feedback (tqdm)
        - Comprehensive result aggregation and reporting
        - Graceful handling of mixed success/failure scenarios
        - Thread-safe operations with proper resource management

    Architecture Benefits:
        - I/O-bound optimization: Uses threading for file operations
        - Resource control: Configurable worker limits prevent system overload
        - Early validation: Filters invalid files before expensive processing
        - Progress visibility: Real-time feedback for long-running operations
        - Resilient design: Continues processing despite individual file failures

    Performance Characteristics:
        - Optimal for I/O-bound file processing workloads
        - Scales linearly with available I/O resources
        - Memory usage remains constant regardless of batch size
        - Processing time depends on slowest file and worker count
        - Network/disk latency is the primary bottleneck

    Usage Examples:
        # Basic batch processing with default settings
        batch_processor = BatchProcessor(file_processor)
        results = batch_processor.process_files(file_list)
        
        # High-throughput processing with more workers
        batch_processor = BatchProcessor(file_processor, max_workers=8)
        results = batch_processor.process_files(large_file_list)
        
        # Result analysis
        successful = [r for r in results if r['status'] == 'success']
        failed = [r for r in results if r['status'] == 'error']

    Thread Safety:
        - All operations are thread-safe by design
        - FileProcessor instances handle concurrent access properly
        - Result collection uses thread-safe operations
        - Progress tracking is synchronized across workers

    Error Handling Strategy:
        - Fail-fast validation for obvious issues (missing files, wrong types)
        - Graceful degradation for processing errors (continues with remaining files)
        - Comprehensive error reporting with context preservation
        - No silent failures - all issues are logged and reported

        Recommendations for max_workers:
            - Local SSD storage: 4-8 workers typically optimal
            - Network storage: 2-4 workers to avoid overwhelming network
            - CPU-intensive operations: Set to CPU core count
            - Memory-constrained systems: Reduce to prevent resource exhaustion

        Note:

        This method implements a fail-fast validation strategy to identify and filter out
        files that cannot be processed, avoiding wasted resources on doomed operations.
        It checks both file existence and format requirements before expensive processing.

        Validation Criteria:
            1. File existence: Verify file exists at specified path
            2. File format: Ensure file has .txt extension (case-insensitive)

                - valid: Files that passed all validation checks
                - invalid: Files that failed validation with reasons

        Validation Logic:
            - Missing files are identified and marked with "Not found"
            - Non-text files are identified and marked with "Not a .txt file"
            - Only files passing all checks are marked as valid
            - Validation is case-insensitive for file extensions

        Performance Notes:
            - Validation is fast (file system metadata only)
            - No file content is read during validation

                - Failure: {"status": "error", "input": "...", "error": "..."}

        Concurrency Model:
            - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound file operations
            - Each worker processes one file at a time independently
            - Worker count is configurable via max_workers parameter
            - Thread pool automatically manages worker lifecycle
            - Results are collected in completion order (not submission order)

        Progress Tracking:
            - Real-time progress bar via tqdm library
            - Shows current progress, estimated time remaining
            - Updates as each file completes processing
            - Provides visual feedback for long-running operations

        Error Handling:
            - Individual file failures don't stop batch processing
            - All errors are captured and included in results
            - Processing continues with remaining files after failures
            - Comprehensive logging of all operations and issues

        Performance Characteristics:
            - Memory usage: O(n) where n = number of files (for results storage)
            - Processing time: Limited by slowest file and worker saturation
            - I/O throughput: Optimized for concurrent file operations
            - CPU usage: Minimal (I/O-bound operations dominate)

        Example:
            >>> batch_processor = BatchProcessor(file_processor, max_workers=4)
            >>> file_list = ["/data/call1.txt", "/data/call2.txt", "/data/call3.txt"]
            >>> results = batch_processor.process_files(file_list)
            >>> 
            >>> # Analyze results
            >>> successful = [r for r in results if r['status'] == 'success']
            >>> failed = [r for r in results if r['status'] == 'error']
            >>> print(f"Processed {len(successful)} files, {len(failed)} failures")

        Thread Safety:
            All operations are designed to be thread-safe, including result collection,
            progress tracking, and logging operations.

    Main execution block demonstrating the complete anonymization pipeline.
    
    This section provides a working example of how to use the anonymization system
    in production. It demonstrates the proper initialization sequence, configuration
    loading, and batch processing execution with comprehensive result handling.
    
    The example shows processing of call recording transcripts with the following
    workflow:
    1. Define input file list with standardized path structure
    2. Load entity configuration from JSON file (with fallback to defaults)
    3. Initialize anonymization pipeline components
    4. Execute concurrent batch processing
    5. Report detailed results with success/failure analysis
    
    This pattern can be adapted for various deployment scenarios including:
    - Scheduled batch processing jobs
    - API endpoint implementations
    - Command-line tools
    - Integration with larger data pipelines
